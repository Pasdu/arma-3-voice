# Arma 3 Voice Commands

## Introduction and Credits

The [original script](https://forums.bohemia.net/forums/topic/120831-glovepie-speech-recognition-script-for-arma2/) was produced by a poster on the bohemia forums named Suchy_.

This was in october of 2011 and today while using the script I've noticed that the way it was written causes many regular key bindings (like alt tabbing) to stop functioning on my system while the script is listening.

I had no clue what I was doing so I turned to another script called [Arma 3 Voice Commands - Extended](https://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=27998). I copied the method for binding the keys from this and used it to rewrite the mappings in Suchy's script.

## Getting Started

This script is written for the GlovePIE 0.45 software. This software has gone sort of dark and so there is an archive of it in the repo with the script copied in if you need it.

**Quick Start**

1. Run the GlovePIE software
2. File > Open the Arma 3 Voice script
3. Click Run

**To Issue voice commands**

Say "vox up" to turn on voice commands and "vox down" to stop the script listening.
